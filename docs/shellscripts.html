<h1>The Drop Shell Scripts</h1>
<p>
A drop shell script is any Unix shell script file that has
its "execute" bit set (i.e., via `chmod +x myscript.drop`)
and that begins with a specific line:
<pre>
	#!/usr/bin/env drop
</pre>
 - or -
<pre> 
	#!/full/path/to/drop
</pre><p>
The former is the usual form, and is more convenient in that
it will allow you to run the script regardless of where drop
has been installed on your system, as long as it appears in
your PATH.  The later form allows you to specify the drop
command add options to use, as in:
<pre>
	#!/full/path/to/drop php-script --some-option
</pre><p>
Adding specific options is important only in certain cases,
described later; it is usually not necessary.
<p>
Drop scripts do not need to be named "*.drop" or "*.script";
they can be named anything at all.  To run them, make sure they 
are executable (`chmod +x helloworld.script`) and then run them 
from the shell like any other script.
<p>
There are two big advantages to drop scripts over bash scripts:
<ul>
<li>They are written in php

<li>drop can bootstrap your Backdrop site before
    running your script.
</ul><p>
To bootstrap a Backdrop site, provide an alias to the site to 
bootstrap as the first commandline argument.
<p>
For example:
<pre>
	$ helloworld.script @dev a b c
</pre><p>
If the first argument is a valid site alias, drop will remove 
it from the arument list and bootstrap that site, then run
your script.  The script itself will not see @dev on its
argument list.  If you do not want drop to remove the first
site alias from your scripts argument list (e.g. if your script
wishes to syncronise two sites, specified by the first two
arguments, and does not want to bootstrap either of those
two sites), then fully specify the drop command (php-script)
and options to use, as shown above.  By default, if the drop
command is not specified, drop will provide the following default
line:
<pre>
	#!/full/path/to/drop php-script --bootstrap-to-first-arg
</pre><p>
It is the option --bootstrap-to-first-arg that causes drop to
pull off the first argument and bootstrap it.  The way to get rid
of that option is to specify the php-script line to run, and leave
it off, like so:
<pre>
	#!/full/path/to/drop php-script
</pre><p>
Note that 'php-script' is the only built-in drop command that
makes sense to put on the "shebang" ("#!" is pronounced "shebang")
line.  However, if you wanted to, you could implement your own
custom version of php-script (e.g. to preprocess the script input,
perhaps), and specify that command on the shebang line.
<p>
Drop scripts can access their arguments via the drop_shift()
function:
<pre>
        while ($arg = drop_shift()) {
          drop_print($arg);
        }
</pre><p>
Options are available via drop_get_option('option-name').
