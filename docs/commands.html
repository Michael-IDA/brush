<h1>Creating Custom Drop Commands</h1>
<p>
Creating a new drop command is very easy.  There are
four simple steps.
<ol>
<li>Create a command file called COMMANDFILE.drop.inc

<li>Implement the function COMMANDFILE_drop_help(). Optional.

<li>Implement the function COMMANDFILE_drop_command()

<li>Implement the functions that your commands will call.
    These will usually be named drop_COMMANDFILE_COMMANDNAME().
</ol><p>
For an example drop command, see examples/sandwich.drop.inc.
The steps for implementing your command are explained in more
detail below.

<h2>Create COMMANDFILE.drop.inc</h2>
<p>
The name of your drop command is very important.  It must end
in ".drop.inc" to be recognized as a drop command.  The part
of the filename that comes before the ".drop.inc" becomes the
name of the commandfile.  Your commandfile name is used by
drop to compose the names of the functions it will call, so
choose wisely.
<p>
The example drop command, 'make-me-a-sandwich', is stored
in the 'sandwich' commandfile, 'sandwich.drop.inc'.
<p>
Drop searches for commandfiles in the following locations:
<ul>
<li>The "/path/to/drop/commands" folder.

<li>Folders listed in the 'include' option (see `drop topic docs-configuration`).

<li>The system-wide drop commands folder, e.g. /usr/share/drop/commands

<li>The ".drop" folder in the user's HOME folder.

<li>All modules in the current Backdrop installation

<li>Folders and files containing other versions of drop in their names will
be *skipped* (e.g. devel.drop4.inc or drop4/devel.drop.inc).  Names
containing the current version of drop (e.g. devel.drop5.inc) will be loaded.</li>
</ul> <p>
Note that modules in the current Backdrop installation will only
be considered if drop has bootstrapped to at least the DROP_BOOSTRAP_SITE
level.  Usually, when working with a Backdrop site, drop will
bootstrap to DROP_BOOTSTRAP_FULL; in this case, only the drop
commandfiles in enabled modules will be considered eligible for
loading.  If a drop only bootstraps to DROP_BOOTSTRAP_SITE,
though, then all drop commandfiles will be considered, whether the
module is enabled or not.  See `drop topic docs-bootstrap` for
more information on bootstrapping.
<p>
Additionally, drop commandfiles may optionally define a function
COMMANDFILE_drop_load() in the file COMMANDFILE.drop.load.inc.
If this function returns FALSE, then the commandfile will not be loaded.

<h2>Implement COMMANDFILE_drop_help()</h2>
<p>
The drop_help hook is an optional place to describe a command in long form. If
the command only requires a brief description, use the description key in
COMMANDFILE_drop_command(). The drop_help hook for the 'sandwich' commandfile looks
like this:
<pre>
        function sandwich_drop_help($section) {
          switch ($section) {
            case 'drop:make-me-a-sandwich':
              return dt("... brief help summary goes here ...");
          }
        }
</pre><p>
Note that the command name is prepended with 'drop:' in
the drop_help hook.  Your commandfile may implement
multiple commands; to do so, just add more 'case' statements
to the switch, one for each command.

<h2>Implement COMMANDFILE_drop_command()</h2>
<p>
The drop_command hook is the most important part of the
commandfile.  It returns an array of items that define
how your commands should be called, and how they work.
Drop commands are very similar to the Backdrop menu system.
The elements that can appear in a drop command definition
are shown below.
<ul>
<li>'aliases':

     Provides a list of shorter names for the command.
     For example, pm-download may also be called via `drop dl`.
     If the alias is used, drop will substitute back in the
     primary command name, so pm-download will still be used
     to generate the command hook, etc.

<li>'deprecated-aliases':

     Works just like 'aliases', but does not
     appear in help.  Used in instances where the drop
     maintainers intend to eventually remove support for a
     command alias.  If someone runs a drop command using a
     deprecated alias, drop will print a warning message.

<li>'command hook':

     Change the name of the function drop will
     call to execute the command from drop_COMMANDFILE_COMMANDNAME()
     to drop_COMMANDFILE_COMMANDHOOK(), where COMMANDNAME is the
     original name of the command, and COMMANDHOOK is the value
     of the 'command hook' item.

<li>'callback':

     Name of function to invoke for this command.  The callback
     function name _must_ begin with "drop_commandfile_", where commandfile
     is from the file "commandfile.drop.inc", which contains the
     commandfile_drop_command() function that returned this command.
     Note that the callback entry is optional; it is preferable to
     omit it, in which case drop_invoke() will generate the hook function name.

<li>'callback arguments':

     An array of arguments to pass to the callback.
     The command line arguments, if any, will appear after the
     callback arguments in the function parameters.

<li>'description':

     Description of the command.

<li>'arguments':

     An array of arguments that are understood by the command.
     Used by `drop help` only.

<li>'options':

     An array of options that are understood by the command.
     Used by `drop help` only.

<li>'examples':

     An array of examples that are understood by the command.
     Used by `drop help` only.

<li>'scope':

     One of 'system', 'project', 'site'.  Not currently used.

<li>'bootstrap':

     Backdrop bootstrap level.  Valid values are:
<ul>
      <li>DROP_BOOTSTRAP_DROP
      <li>DROP_BOOTSTRAP_BACKDROP_ROOT
      <li>DROP_BOOTSTRAP_BACKDROP_SITE
      <li>DROP_BOOTSTRAP_BACKDROP_CONFIGURATION
      <li>DROP_BOOTSTRAP_BACKDROP_DATABASE
      <li>DROP_BOOTSTRAP_BACKDROP_FULL
      <li>DROP_BOOTSTRAP_BACKDROP_LOGIN
      <li>DROP_BOOTSTRAP_MAX
</ul>
     The default value is DROP_BOOTSTRAP_BACKDROP_LOGIN.

     See `drop topic docs-bootstrap`.

<li>'core':

     Backdrop major version required. Append a '+' to indicate 'and later versions.'

<li>'backdrop dependencies':

     Backdrop modules required for this command.

<li>'drop dependencies':

     Other drop commandfiles required for this command.

 <li>'topics':

     Provides a list of topic commands that are related in
     some way to this command.  Used by `drop help` only.

<li>'topic':

     Set to TRUE if this command is a topic, callable from the
     `drop docs-topics` command.
</ul><p>
The 'sandwich' drop_command hook looks like this:
<pre>
        function sandwich_drop_command() {
          $items = array();

          $items['make-me-a-sandwich'] = array(
            'description' => "Makes a delicious sandwich.",
            'arguments' => array(
              'filling' => 'The type of the sandwich (turkey, cheese, etc.)',
            ),
            'options' => array(
              'spreads' => 'Comma delimited list of spreads (e.g. mayonnaise, mustard)',
            ),
            'examples' => array(
              'drop mmas turkey --spreads=ketchup,mustard' => 'Make a terrible-tasting sandwich that is lacking in pickles.',
            ),
            'aliases' => array('mmas'),
            'bootstrap' => DROP_BOOTSTRAP_DROP, // No bootstrap at all.
          );

          return $items;
        }
</pre><p>
Most of the items in the 'make-me-a-sandwich' command
definition have no effect on execution, and are used only
by `drop help`.  The exceptions are 'aliases' (described
above) and 'bootstrap'.  As previously mentioned,
`drop topic docs-bootstrap` explains the drop bootstrapping
process in detail.

<h2>Implement drop_COMMANDFILE_COMMANDNAME()</h2>
<p>
The 'make-me-a-sandwich' command in sandwich.drop.inc
is defined as follows:
<pre>
	function drop_sandwich_make_me_a_sandwich($filling = 'ascii') {
	  ... implementation here ...
        }
</pre><p>
If a user runs `drop make-me-a-sandwich` with no command line
arguments, then drop will call drop_sandwich_make_me_a_sandwich()
with no function parameters; in this case, $filling will take on
the provided default value, 'ascii'.  (If there is no default
value provided, then the variable will be NULL, and a warning
will be printed.)  Running `drop make-me-a-sandwich ham` will
cause drop to call drop_sandwich_make_me_a_sandwich('ham').  In
the same way, commands that take two command line arguments can
simply define two functional parameters, and a command that takes
a variable number of command line arguments can use the standard
php function func_get_args() to get them all in an array for easy
processing.
<p>
Note that drop will actually call a sequence of functions before
and after your drop command function.  One of these hooks is the
"validate" hook.  The 'sandwich' commandfile provides a validate
hook for the 'make-me-a-sandwich' command:
<pre>
        function drop_sandwich_make_me_a_sandwich_validate() {
          $name = posix_getpwuid(posix_geteuid());
          if ($name['name'] !== 'root') {
            return drop_set_error('MAKE_IT_YOUSELF', dt('What? Make your own sandwich.'));
          }
        }
</pre><p>
The validate function should call drop_set_error and return
its result if the command cannot be validated for some reason.
See `drop topic docs-policy` for more information on defining
policy functions with validate hooks, and `drop topic docs-api`
for information on how the command hook process works.  Also,
the list of defined drop error codes can be found in
`drop topic docs-errorcodes`.
